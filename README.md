# File-distributor

This tool is used to create txt file containing all files in designated folder, divided by groups of certain size.
For example, if you have folder A with files A1 and A2 which are both 200 MB and folder B with files B1 and B2 which are both 400 MB, then if you use this tool and set folder size to 600 MB you will receive something like this:
```
A1
B1

A2
B2
```
It can be very useful when you need to write a lot of files to a lot of DVDs, for example. This is the reason this tool was created in the first place, actually.
